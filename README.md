# Node Girls FAQ

## What is Node Girls?

Node Girls runs free bootcamps in Node.js for women, inspired by [Rails Girls](http://railsgirls.com/) and [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/). Right now we're just in London, but we hope to spread the Node love around the globe very soon.

### What does a Node Girls event involve?

At the moment we're running one-day introductory Node.js workshops. This involves building a Node.js server from scratch, and an introduction to testing your server code. You should leave with a basic understanding of Node, and resources to progress further with your learning.

In the future we hope to add higher-level Node.js workshops. If there's a particular workshop you'd like to see (or run!), raise an issue on this repo.

### Who is Node Girls for?

Node Girls is a women-only organisation, open to all female-identified people, including trans* women. The organisation is for all ages, although more specifically aimed at women with some background in coding.

### Do I need to know JavaScript?

Yes. This is not an introduction to writing JavaScript. In order to learn Node you will need to be fairly confident with JavaScript.

### Do I need to know another back end language?

No. Experience with another server-side language such as Python might be helpful, but it is *definitely* not required. Front end developers are very welcome.

### I want to help out or mentor at Node Girls

Awesome! We'd love female mentors with Node.js experience to help out with the workshop. Send us an email: nodegirlslondon@gmail.com

### I want to sponsor Node Girls

Yes please! We'd love sponsorship to help cover the costs of running our events. Drop us a message: nodegirlslondon@gmail.com
