# Node Girls FAQ

### What is Node Girls?

Node Girls runs free bootcamps in JavaScript and Node.js for women, non-binary and trans folk. We were inspired by [Rails Girls](http://railsgirls.com/) and [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/) to create something awesome for the JavaScript community. Right now there are chapters running around the world.

### I want to help out or mentor at Node Girls

Note that in some cities the mentoring team is limited to women and non-binary folk.
